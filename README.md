This repository contains the code for an integrated webmap using MapBox Studio and MapBox GL JS.

This is a webpage designed to be a tool to visualize and explore the income distribution across the Greater Toronto Area. 

* Income data was derived from [CHASS][1] Data Centre (UofT), a streamlined version of the Canadian National Census Data. 
* The CSD and CT boundaries were sourced from the [Census Geography][2] website.
* The [Open Data][3] Toronto Portal has data regarding the subway shapefiles.
